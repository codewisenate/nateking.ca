				<h2>I'm an Internet professional</h2>
				<p>The Internet. A network of billions of devices enabling global access to almost any information,
					allowing near instantaneous communication between any individuals using it. In the early days of my
					career I receieved many puzzled looks when people asked what I did for a living, but that is no
					longer the case. The Internet is everywhere and encompasses the totality of human information but
					for some reason we can only assume has something to do with my professional life, of all the
					billions of websites available to you on this global network, you ended up here. So since you've
					arrived on this figurative needle in humanity's largest haystack, I encourage you to read on to
					learn a little bit about me and my work. Hopefully you'll find it worth your while.</p>

				<h2>I lead from the front</h2>
				<p>I am a seasoned creative and technical executive experienced in managing people, departments, and
					companies. My approach to leadership is to set the pace, direction, and example for those working
					with me. And I attempt to do so with as much of a sense of humour as I can muster. With all that in
					mind let me offer an analogy: if my career and business experience were a horse race, I'd have a
					stand full of people screaming incoherently at me, a pack of competitors thundering along on all
					sides, and a crop-happy jockey on my back seemingly along for the ride. But in reality my day-to-day
					is focused on converting ideas to tangible reality, while dealing with interpersonal issues, extreme
					deadlines, and financial pressures. ... Ok, now that I think about it, it's pretty much the same
					thing; except the horse has a finish line.</p>

						<p class="slider-description">The Internet has evolved since I first began building websites in
							1994. Technologies change which meant keeping pace or risk becoming a relic. I chose the
							former. Along side leadership and management capabilities, I'm proficient in
							<script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script> full-stack
							web development technologies and techniques, but I'm also no stranger to video. I have been
							involved in creating, producing, directing, editing, animating and compositing for
							productions ranging from simple web based delivery, to live streaming webcasts, and even
							<a style="color: #fff;" href="https://theleftcoastseries.com" target="_blank">broadcast
								television</a> (hint: be prepared to '<em>secede!</em>'). And if the work is graphical,
							I'm comfortable and capable of dealing with it whether designed for digital delivery or
							traditional print mediums. While there is much I can continue to say about my efforts,
							perhaps a sample of a few projects I have had the opportunity to work on will speak to their
							quality.</p>
